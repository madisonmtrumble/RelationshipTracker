# RelationshipTracker
Code for tracking the amount of times the player has talked to certain NPCs and updating their relationship based on the interactions!

I'm Madison and I'm about to graduate with my BS in Game Design! This code specifically comes from my capstone project I am working on with 3 other graduating students. The reference game was Stardew Valley, for it's social simulator aspect. This is the beginning of our social system coming to fruition!
